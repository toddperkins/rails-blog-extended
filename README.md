# Rails blog tutorial extended
The default rails blog tutorial was missing some things and felt like it wasn't really rounded off to well so I extended on the tutorial.
* Added ability to delete comments
* Seed database
* Rspec testing
* Styled with bootstrap

## Installation

Clone this repo down to your computer and cd into that directory.

Modify the database.rb file to use your database adapter and credentials.

Run the following shell commands:

```
$> rails db:create
$> rails db:migrate
$> rails db:seed
$> rails server
```
