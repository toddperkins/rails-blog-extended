# Rails blog tutorial extended
The default rails blog tutorial was missing some things and felt like it wasn't really rounded off to well so I extended on the tutorial.
* Added ability to delete comments
* Seed database
* Rspec testing
* Styled with bootstrap

## Installation
Clone this repo down to your computer and cd into that directory and run the following shell commands:

```
$> rails db:create
$> rails db:migrate
$> rails db:seed
$> rails server
```
